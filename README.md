# Go Client-Server Quiz
A small client-server in go. The client connects to the server to answer a quiz and gets a result.

# How to use
Run the server first, then the client. Use the argument quiz to start a new quiz.
The server listens locally on port 8080, you may want to change that depending on what you have running on your machine.
